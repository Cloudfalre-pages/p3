                        I&apos;m exactly <Age /> years old. I&apos;ve been
                        programming somewhat consistently since I was around 5
                        years old and first given a laptop, where I started
                        hosting Minecraft Servers and creating shell scripts for
                        automation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At 13, I won my first competition with a Discord
                        commission bot that I made in Python, I was also the
                        youngest participant by 5 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, I mostly work on Systems, Infrastructure, and Web
                        Development in Typescript and Rust. I was accepted into
                        college for extraordinary ability, but dropped out to
                        work full-time on my projects, and have been doing so
                        for the past 2 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything I know is entirely self-taught, tutorials are
                        a waste of time - you learn by doing and failing. If you
                        want to learn a programming language, take apart a
                        project in said language and intentionally break it,
                        then fix it. Just rinse and repeat until you understand
                        the core concepts.
                    </p>
